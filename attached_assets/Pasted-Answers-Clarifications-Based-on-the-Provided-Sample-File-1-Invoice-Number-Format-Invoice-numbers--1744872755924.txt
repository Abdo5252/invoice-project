Answers & Clarifications Based on the Provided Sample File
1. Invoice Number Format
Invoice numbers are always preceded by the keyword INVOICE N:.

The format of the invoice number follows a consistent prefix, such as SI244062.

✅ Assumption: All invoice numbers will follow the SIxxxxx pattern after the INVOICE N: label.

2. Customer Code Format
Customer codes appear near the label partner code:.

Codes follow a consistent format like C0080, with the prefix C.

✅ Assumption: Customer codes always begin with the letter C and follow the pattern Cxxxx.

3. Date Format
Dates typically appear next to the invoice header or somewhere at the top.

They are formatted as MM/DD/YYYY, such as 4/16/2025.

✅ Assumption: This is the preferred date format for the extracted data.

4. Fields to Extract
From Header Section (once per invoice):

Field	Example Value	Notes
Invoice Number	SI244062	From INVOICE N:
Invoice Date	4/16/2025	Date near the header
Customer Code	C0080	From partner code:
Currency	EGP or USD	Usually found near the top
Exchange Rate	0	Default to 0 if not found
Activity Code	(blank)	Optional; default to ""
Extra Discount	0	Default to 0 if not found
From Items Table (can be multiple rows):

Field	Example Value	Notes
Description	STICKER 1.5*3 CM -SIZES	Appears under Description or التسمية
Quantity	3440.00	Appears under Quantity or الكمية
Unit Price	0.2500	Appears under Unit price or سعر الوحدة
✅ Note: All product details are tabular and appear in a section following the header info.

5. Handling Arabic Headers
Column headers may appear in Arabic or English.

Examples:

"التسمية" = Description

"الكمية" = Quantity

"سعر الوحدة" = Unit price

✅ Required Logic: Use flexible keyword detection to support both Arabic and English headers when identifying product details.

6. Handling Missing Values
If any field is missing:

Use "0" for missing numeric fields (like Exchange Rate, Discount).

Use empty string "" for optional text fields (like Activity Code).

✅ This ensures consistent and clean output formatting.

7. Output File Structure
All invoices should be stored in one sheet, not one sheet per invoice.

Each invoice includes:

A single header row with invoice data.

One or more item rows, linked to the invoice.

✅ Data should follow the format shown in the reference images provided earlier:

Header and Item sections are combined in one Excel sheet.

A clear link is maintained between invoice headers and their items.

8. Priority Rule for Duplicate Data
If multiple values are found for the same field:

✅ Take the first match found (based on reading order from top to bottom).

✅ Summary of Requirements
Input: Excel file with multiple unstructured sheets.

Output: One structured Excel sheet with all invoice data.

Must support both English and Arabic keywords.

Extract only specific fields (no extra or unrelated data).

Handle missing values gracefully.

Maintain clear separation and linkage between headers and items.
