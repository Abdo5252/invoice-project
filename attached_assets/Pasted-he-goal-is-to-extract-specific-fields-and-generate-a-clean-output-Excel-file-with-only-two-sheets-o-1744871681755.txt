he goal is to extract specific fields and generate a clean output Excel file with only two sheets: one for invoice headers and another for item lines.

⚠️ The messy Excel files can have different formats and random placements for data, so smart keyword detection is required.

✅ Required Output Format (Final Excel File):
📄 Sheet 1: Header
Should contain one row per invoice, with the following columns:


Column Name	Example Value	Notes
Document Type	I	Always "I"
Document Number	SI244015	Extracted from label: INVOICE N:
Document Date	4/16/2025	Usually near invoice number
Customer Code	C0033	Extracted from label: partner code:
Currency Code	EGP	Extracted from label like: EGP, USD
Exchange Rate	0	Default to 0
Extra Discount	0	Default to 0
Activity Code		Leave empty if not available
📦 Sheet 2: Items
Should contain one row per item line (multiple rows per invoice if needed):


Column Name	Example	Notes
Document Number	SI244015	Same as in Header sheet (used as foreign key)
Description	HEAT SEALTRANSFER 2.5*6 CM - SIZES...	Detected under column: Description or التسمية
Unit Type	(optional)	If not found, leave blank
Quantity	27370	Detected under Quantity or الكمية
Unit Price	0.25	Detected under Unit price or سعر الوحدة
Discount Amount	0	Default to 0
Value Difference	0	Default to 0
Item Discount	0	Default to 0
🔍 Extraction Logic & Method:
The input Excel file may contain multiple sheets, each with an invoice in an unstructured layout.

For each sheet:

Use keyword search (case-insensitive) to locate:

INVOICE N: → followed by the document number

partner code: → followed by the customer code

Currency: find values like EGP, USD

Use table detection or keyword anchors like Description, Quantity, Unit Price to locate the items table (product lines).

Column headers might appear in English or Arabic (e.g., التسمية, الكمية, سعر الوحدة)

Read downwards until a blank row or something invalid.

If a value is not found (e.g. exchange rate), use a default value like 0 or an empty string.

Append all headers and all item lines into one final Excel file with two sheets:

One row per invoice in Header

One row per product in Items, linked to the corresponding invoice by Document Number

Document Type	Document Number	Document Date	Customer Code	Currency Code	Exchange Rate	Extra Discount	Activity Code

Items Sheet Example:
